* Insert new nodes in-place, so that the string of characters inside a node
  is taken sorted, and we can use binary search or just stop scanning
  once a char greater than the one we are looking for is found.
* Test the insertion of strings greater then 512 MB.
* Avoid fixing the parent link if the node is the same, if this makes a speed difference because of the avoided cache miss.
* Make the code alignment-safe.
* Handle OOM everywhere.
* Change trie...() into radtree()...
* All the low level node management functions should be called radtreeNode...()
