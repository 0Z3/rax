* Insert new nodes in-place, so that the string of characters inside a node
  is taken sorted, and we can use binary search or just stop scanning
  once a char greater than the one we are looking for is found.
* Allow the insertion of strings greater then 512 MB. We need to check that
  the compressed node length is split when this size is reached and a new
  linked node is created.
